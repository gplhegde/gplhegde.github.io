This project uses supervised learning method using [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) database. A three layer neural network with 25 hidden neurons is used to make the classification. This implementation achieves ~95% training and ~92% testing accuracy over MNIST dataset.\r\nSource code can be found [here](https://github.com/gplhegde/detect-my-digits)\r\n* __Visual Saliency Detection__\r\n\r\nSource code can be found [here](https://github.com/gplhegde/Visual_saliency_detection)\r\n* __Deep Learning Stack Implementation on Soft Vector Processor__\r\n\r\nGet the source code [here](https://github.com/gplhegde/Deep_learning_SoC)\r\n* __Time-predictable DDR3 DRAM Controller__\r\n.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
